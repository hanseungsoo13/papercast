# Tasks: HuggingFace Podcast Automation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-huggingface-podcast-automation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per Constitution (TDD approach). All user stories include comprehensive test coverage.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow single project structure from plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project directory structure per implementation plan
- [x] T002 Initialize Python 3.11 project with requirements.txt
- [x] T003 [P] Create .env.example file with required environment variables
- [x] T004 [P] Create .gitignore for Python project (venv, __pycache__, .env, *.pyc)
- [x] T005 [P] Configure pytest with pytest.ini and coverage settings
- [x] T006 [P] Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [x] T007 [P] Create data/ directory structure (podcasts/, logs/)
- [x] T008 [P] Create static-site/ directory structure

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T009 [P] Create Paper model with Pydantic validation in src/models/paper.py
- [x] T010 [P] Create Podcast model with Pydantic validation in src/models/podcast.py
- [x] T011 [P] Create ProcessingLog model with Pydantic validation in src/models/processing_log.py
- [x] T012 [P] Implement logger utility in src/utils/logger.py
- [x] T013 [P] Implement config utility in src/utils/config.py
- [x] T014 [P] Implement retry decorator with tenacity in src/utils/retry.py
- [x] T015 Create __init__.py files for all src/ subdirectories

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for podcast data
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (MANDATORY) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services (but models are in Foundational phase)
- Services before main pipeline
- Core implementation before GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions before deployment
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (MANDATORY):
Task: "Unit test for Paper collection in tests/unit/test_collector.py"
Task: "Unit test for summary generation in tests/unit/test_summarizer.py"
Task: "Unit test for TTS conversion in tests/unit/test_tts.py"
Task: "Unit test for GCS upload in tests/unit/test_uploader.py"
Task: "Contract test for Hugging Face API in tests/contract/test_huggingface_api.py"
Task: "Contract test for Gemini API in tests/contract/test_gemini_api.py"
Task: "Contract test for Google TTS API in tests/contract/test_google_tts_api.py"
Task: "Contract test for GCS API in tests/contract/test_gcs_api.py"

# After tests are written and failing, implement services in parallel:
# (Note: These can't truly be parallel as they form a pipeline, but can be developed independently)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (priority focus)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (can start in parallel after US1 creates data)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (independent monitoring features)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD requirement per Constitution)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **CRITICAL**: US2 depends on US1 for podcast data generation
- **CRITICAL**: All tests are MANDATORY per Constitution (TDD approach)
- Test coverage goal: 80%+ overall, 100% for core business logic
